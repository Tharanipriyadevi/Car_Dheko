Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars, enhancing customer experience by providing accurate price estimates. 
The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Extensive cleaning and feature engineering on car data, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights derived from univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations, along with correlation analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were evaluated, with Random Forest chosen for deployment due to its superior performance.
Streamlit App: A user-friendly interface where users can input car details to get instant price predictions. Integrated with a Random Forest model for high accuracy.

Python Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
Deployment: Hosted via a cloud platform for easy access
